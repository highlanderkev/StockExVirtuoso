{"name":"KPW - Stock Ex Virtuoso","tagline":"Virtual Stock Exchange written in Java","body":"Stock Exchange Virtuoso\r\n==========================\r\nA fully functional virtual stock exchange written in Java. \r\n\r\nProject Overview: \r\n-----------------\r\nThis project stems from a software engineering project I worked on for SE 350 Object-Oriented Software Development \r\nand is meant to be a fully functional virtual stock exchange.\r\n\r\n* It is capable of hosting multiple clients in a virtual stock environment, where the clients can buy and sell virtual stocks.\r\n* There is currently no real data being used besides what you provide it. \r\n* It is just a framework (empty shell/canvas) for experimenting.\r\n\r\nLooking forward:\r\n----------------\r\nCurrently, I am looking into ways to make this more practical for someone looking to get more trading experience or \r\nexperiment with trading algorithms like high-frequency trading algorithms. As there is already a good platform \r\nfor this at [Quantopian](https://www.quantopian.com/), I am currently investigating other avenues for this. \r\nI am open to suggestions at [mail@kevinpatrickwestropp.org](mailto:mail@kevinpatrickwestropp.org).\r\n\r\nLicense: \r\n---------\r\nUnless otherwise noted this covered by the [Creative Commons License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/).","google":"UA-41364525-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
