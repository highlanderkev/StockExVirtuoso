Stock Exchange Virtuoso
==========================
A fully functional virtual stock exchange written in Java. 

Project Overview: 
-----------------
This project stems from a software engineering project I worked on for SE 350 Object-Oriented Software Development 
and is meant to be a fully functional virtual stock exchange.
(But what does that mean?) 
* It is capable of hosting multiple clients in a virtual stock environment, where the clients can buy and sell virtual stocks.
* There is currently no real data being used besides what you provide it. 
* It is just a framework (empty shell/canvas) for experimenting.

Looking forward:
----------------
Currently, I am looking into ways to make this more practical for someone looking to get more trading experience or 
experiment with trading algorithms like high-frequency trading algorithms. As there is already a good platform 
for this at [Quantopian](https://www.quantopian.com/), I am currently investigating other avenues for this. 
I am open to suggestions at [kevinwestropp@live.com](mailto:kevinwestropp@live.com).
