  </h3>

    <p>This project stems from a software engineering project I worked on for SE 350 Object-Oriented Software Development and is meant to be a fully functional virtual stock exchange.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>It is capable of hosting multiple clients in a virtual stock environment, where the clients can buy and sell virtual stocks.</li>
      <li>There is currently no real data being used besides what you provide it. </li>
      <li>It is just a framework (empty shell/canvas) for experimenting.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
      <a name="looking-forward" class="anchor" href="#looking-forward"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Looking forward:
    </h3>

    <p>Currently, I am looking into ways to make this more practical for someone looking to get more trading experience or experiment with trading algorithms like high-frequency trading algorithms. As there is already a good platform for this at <a href="https://www.quantopian.com/">Quantopian</a>, I am currently investigating other avenues for this. I am open to suggestions at <a href="mailto:mail@kevinpatrickwestropp.org">mail@kevinpatrickwestropp.org</a>.</p>
